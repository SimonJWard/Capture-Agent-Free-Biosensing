## 2. Experimental Data
### 2.1 Porous Silicon
Porous Silicon (PSi) is silicon with nanostructured pores, which have been electrochemically etched using hydrofluoric acid. Below are shown some images on the scale of a few nanometres taken using an electron microscope, and and illustration of how molecules are captured and detected optically in the pores.

### 2.2 Data Collection
Porous silicon sensors were electrochemically etched at a current density of either 55 mA cm−2, 40 mA cm−2, or 25 mA cm−2, to form thin films with different pore size distributions for the different elements in the sensing array, and diced into 5mm x 5mm squares.

The sensor was used to identify and quantify three different proteins: chicken ovalbumin (OVA), bovine seruma albumin (BSA), and avidin, each with a unique combination of molecule size and isoelectric point, which both determine how readily they are captured in the pores, prepared in solutions using either pH4 or pH10 buffers.

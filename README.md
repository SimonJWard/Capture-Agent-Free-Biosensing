## 2. Experimental Data
### 2.1 Porous Silicon
Porous Silicon (PSi) is silicon with nanostructured pores, which have been electrochemically etched using hydrofluoric acid. Below are shown some images on the scale of a few nanometres taken using an electron microscope, and and illustration of how molecules are captured and detected optically in the pores.
